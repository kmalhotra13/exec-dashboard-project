This project was a great time. I'd recommend ensuring a proper installation of Python on your computer, as it took a while for me to figure out why certain packages weren't running, and it turned out I needed to update python. 

The project's goal is to provide information on a chosen file and help visualize it. Later iterations will allow for it to incorporate multiple months' worth of data.

the original project to spec is entitled "monthly_sales.py" in this repository

<b>Further Exploration:</b>
Taking this a step further, I used the pandas package to validate the headers of the CSV. This can be found at "monthly_sales_with_validation.py" within the repository. Also, a dummy CSV file was created with incorrect headers (changing 'date' to 'time') for testing purposes, though this will validate any CSV that does not match the headers necessary. The dummy CSV is 'sales-199501.csv' within the monthly-sales folder of the repository.
