This project was a great time. I'd recommend ensuring a proper installation of Python on your computer, as it took a while for me to figure out why certain packages weren't running, and it turned out I needed to update python. 

The project's goal is to provide information on a chosen file and help visualize it. Later iterations will allow for it to incorporate multiple months' worth of data.
